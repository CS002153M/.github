> **Tetris AI**
> *One of the classic games that have retained its charm and appeal across generations is Tetris. Its simple yet engaging mechanics make it a perfect bridge to connect the older generation to the world of gaming. However, while its basics are straightforward, mastering Tetris and understanding the strategic depth it offers can still be a challenge for many, especially for those who aren't accustomed to gaming.
Recognizing this issue, our project aims to introduce a Tetris AI that will integrate with our own Tetris client. This AI is designed to guide elderly players through the best possible moves in real-time. The dual objective here is to facilitate their understanding of not just Tetris, but the broader framework of strategic gaming.*
